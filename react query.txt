In React Query, the useMutation hook is a part of the library's API that provides a simple and efficient way to handle data mutations, such as creating, updating, or deleting data on the server. React Query is a state management library that specializes in managing remote data and provides various hooks to interact with your API endpoints and manage the associated state.

Here's what useMutation does in React Query:

Definition of a Mutation Function: When you use the useMutation hook, you define a mutation function. This function is expected to perform some operation that mutates data on the server, like making a POST request to create a new resource, a PUT request to update an existing one, or a DELETE request to remove a resource. This function should be asynchronous since network requests are typically involved.

Mutation Trigger: The useMutation hook returns an object that contains the mutation function, typically named mutate. You can then trigger the mutation by calling this mutate function. It takes care of sending the request and handling the response.

Automatic State Management: React Query handles the state management for you. When you call the mutate function and it triggers the mutation, React Query will automatically:

Update the local cache with the new data if the mutation was successful, keeping your application's state in sync.
Update any components that depend on the mutated data, re-rendering them with the updated data.
Handle errors and retries if the mutation fails, based on the configuration and policies you define.
Optimistic Updates: React Query also supports optimistic updates, which means it can update the local state optimistically before the response from the server arrives. This provides a smoother user experience.
